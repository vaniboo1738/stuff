### GROUP MEMBERS: Jarisse Escubido, Vanisa Suadprathon, Val DeLeon

## __Assignment Instructions__
For this week's assignment, you will be working in a group of 2-4 students to refactor a project provided by your instructor. Your objective is to modify the code in a way that allows for easy modifications such as altering object locations, quantities, and sizes. The main goal of this assignment is to enable the project to be quickly adapted to meet various requirements or design preferences.

To get started, you will need to create a fork of the original project and then work collaboratively to refactor the codebase. You will need to think carefully about how you structure the code to ensure it is modular and easy to maintain. Additionally, you will need to ensure that the code adheres to best practices and coding conventions to ensure it is easily understandable by others.

An important aspect of this assignment is the application of structural programming techniques. You will need to edit the program in a functional form, focusing on organizing your code into clear, concise, and reusable functions that can be easily combined and modified as needed.

Throughout the assignment, you will be expected to communicate effectively with your group members using Git as a version control system. Git will help you collaborate on the project, track changes, and resolve conflicts that may arise during the development process. At the end of the assignment, you will need to publish your final project on a GitHub page, making sure to include all necessary documentation and a clear README file.

By the end of the assignment, you should have a well-organized and easily modifiable codebase that can be adapted to meet a range of requirements or design preferences, utilizing structural programming techniques for efficient and functional code. Remember, you can form groups of 2 to 4 students for this assignment, depending on your preferences and the availability of your classmates.
